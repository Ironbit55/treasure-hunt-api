# treasure-hunt-api
Backend for university coursework to create a treasure hunt application. This backend exposes a restFull(ish) API to be used by a mobile app (for treasure hunt participants) and website (for treasure hunt creators/administrators).

This was part of a larger project folder that included the website. Both we're deployed on a server provided by the university following a LAMP stack (feels so old now haha). 
This has a dependency on an MySql server. I'd have no idea how to actually build or run this anymore.
